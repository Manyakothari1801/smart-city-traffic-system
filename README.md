# Smart City Traffic Management System

## Overview
This project is a full-stack academic system designed to demonstrate how modern database systems and web technologies can be used to manage urban traffic efficiently. It focuses on real-time incident tracking, traffic signal management, and data integrity.

## Problem Statement
Urban traffic systems generate large amounts of data, and traditional static systems fail to handle real-time monitoring and decision-making effectively.

## Key Features
- User authentication with role-based access (admin, authority, user)
- Incident reporting and lifecycle management
- Traffic signal monitoring and control
- Real-time dashboard updates using Socket.IO
- Normalized relational database design

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React (TypeScript)
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MySQL
- Real-time: Socket.IO
- Authentication: JWT
- Maps: Leaflet

## What I Learned
- Database schema design (ER models, normalization, constraints)
- REST API integration with frontend
- Real-time systems using WebSockets
- Building scalable full-stack architectures

## Project Report
The full academic report is available in this repository as a PDF.
